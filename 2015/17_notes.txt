I have not figure out if there is better way (like order of magnitude).
However is worth to point out that if collection is sorted it is possible to limit brute force search.
If for any i in range [1,N] sum(collection[:N]) is not greater than sum that we are looking for (descending order), there is no point of testing that small number of chosen values.
On the other hand, for ascending sort order if the same sum is lower than seached value, we have to consider that even more items might sum to exact value
